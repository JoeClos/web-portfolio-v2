Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
This space showcases a selection of my most meaningful and creative development projects — built with passion, empathy, and a strong eye for detail.

## 🧠 About Me

I’m Josephine, a frontend developer who bridges technology and design to craft thoughtful digital experiences.  
When I’m not coding, I’m exploring nature, experimenting with new ideas, or helping others grow.
